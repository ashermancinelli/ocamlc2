## Summary

To add functor support to a Hindley–Milner (HM) style OCaml type checker, you must (1) extend your representation of types to include *module types* (signatures) and *functor types* (signatures → signatures); (2) generate constraints not only on core expressions but also on module expressions and functor definitions/applications; (3) implement a **module‐level unification** algorithm that solves constraints on signatures by matching value descriptions, type declarations, and nested modules; (4) adapt your inference driver (Algorithm W) so that when you see

```ocaml
module F (M : S1) : S2 = struct … end
```

you (a) check that the body implements `S2` under an environment where `M` has signature `S1`, (b) record that `F` has functor type `S1 → S2`, and (c) generalize appropriately; and (5) at functor application

```ocaml
module N = F (Arg)
```

you (a) infer the signature `SigArg` of `Arg`, (b) unify `SigArg` with the formal parameter `S1` of `F`, and (c) instantiate the result signature `S2` of `F` in the current environment. Below we outline each piece in turn.

## 1. Representing Module and Functor Types

### 1.1 Signatures as First‐Class Types

In OCaml, a *signature* (or module type) is a collection of:

- **Value declarations**: `val x : τ`  
- **Type declarations**: `type t = …` or abstract `type t`  
- **Submodule declarations**: `module A : S_A`  
- **Functor declarations**: `module F : S_param → S_body`  

Your type‐checker must have an AST node, say `modtype`, to represent each of these forms  ([Functors - Real World OCaml](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/functors.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### 1.2 Functor Types

A *functor type* `S1 → S2` is itself a module type: it denotes a function from any module matching signature `S1` to a module matching `S2` (where inside `S2` you can refer to the formal parameter’s components). Represent it as an arrow in your `modtype` data type  ([5.9. Functors — OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/modules/functors.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## 2. Unification of Module Types

### 2.1 From Core‐Level to Module‐Level Unification

At the core of HM inference lies unification of type expressions (`int`, `'a → 'b`, etc.)  ([How does the OCaml type inferencing algorithm work?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12717690/how-does-the-ocaml-type-inferencing-algorithm-work?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). For modules, unification must work over *signatures*:

1. **Structural matching**: Two signatures unify if they have exactly the same components (same names, same arities, same variance for types, and so on).  
2. **Value‐level unification**: For each `val x : τ1` in `S1` and `val x : τ2` in `S2`, unify `τ1` with `τ2` via your existing type‐unification routine  ([Efficient and Insightful Generalization - okmij.org](https://okmij.org/ftp/ML/generalization.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
3. **Type declarations**: Abstract types must match in arity and generativity. Generative type constructors require fresh “stamp” distinctions, while applicative ones can be identified structurally  ([ML Family Workshop - syslog - University of Cambridge](https://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/2014/09/05/ml-family-workshop/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
4. **Submodules and nested functors**: Recursively unify nested modules’ signatures, including functors as arrow types  ([[PDF] OCaml modules: formalization, insights and improvements - Hal-Inria](https://inria.hal.science/hal-03526068/file/main.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Formally, define a function:

```ocaml
val unify_modtype : signature * signature -> unit
```

that raises an error if the two signatures cannot be made identical by unifying all constituent parts.

### 2.2 Signature Inclusion (Subtyping)

OCaml’s module system also supports *signature inclusion* (a form of nominal subtyping): a module of signature `S` can be used where a “larger” signature `T` is expected if `S` implements at least the components of `T`. This is checked by ensuring every declaration in `T` appears and unifies in `S`  ([The Compiler Frontend: Parsing And Type Checking - OCaml](https://ocaml.org/docs/compiler-frontend?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). You may implement this by iterating over declarations in `T` and looking them up in `S`, unifying as above.

## 3. Functor Type Inference

### 3.1 Inferring Functor Definitions

Given

```ocaml
module F (M : S1) = struct … end
```

1. **Extend the environment** with a fresh module variable `M` bound to signature `S1`.  
2. **Type‐check** the structure body under this environment, inferring its signature `S2′`.  
3. **Unify** `S2′` against any ascription `: S2`; if none is given, let the declared signature be `S2 := S2′`.  
4. **Generalize** any abstract types in `S2` that do not refer to the functor parameter by quantifying them (à la HM generalization, but over types within signatures)  ([Efficient and Insightful Generalization - okmij.org](https://okmij.org/ftp/ML/generalization.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
5. **Record** that `F` has functor type `S1 → S2`.

### 3.2 Inferring Functor Applications

For 

```ocaml
module N = F (Arg)
```

1. **Infer** the signature `SigArg` of `Arg` by type‐checking the structure expression `Arg`.  
2. **Unify** `SigArg` with the formal parameter `S1` of `F`.  
3. **Instantiate** the result signature `S2` of `F` by copying and renaming any abstract components according to how `Arg` maps to `S1`.  
4. **Bind** `N` to that instantiated signature.

This parallels Algorithm W’s instantiation of polymorphic type schemes, but at the module‐level  ([[PDF] Type systems for programming languages - Gallium](https://gallium.inria.fr/~remy/mpri/cours-fomega.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

## 4. Implementation Guidelines

### 4.1 Data Structures

- **`core_type`**: your existing HM types with type variables and constructors.  
- **`module_expr`**: AST for structures, functor expressions, and applications.  
- **`signature`**: descriptors for `val`, `type`, `module`, and `module type`.  
- **`env`**: maps identifiers to either `core_type scheme` or `signature`.

### 4.2 Algorithms

1. **Constraint Generation**: As you traverse `module_expr`, collect constraints on `signature`s just as you collect type‐equations in core HM inference  ([Writing type inference algorithms in OCaml - Learning](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/writing-type-inference-algorithms-in-ocaml/8191?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).  
2. **Unification / Solving**: First solve all core‐level type equations. Then solve module‐level constraints using `unify_modtype`.  
3. **Generalization**: When leaving a `struct … end` or functor definition, generalize any abstract‐type components whose definitions do not depend on the current environment level  ([Efficient and Insightful Generalization - okmij.org](https://okmij.org/ftp/ML/generalization.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### 4.3 Generative vs. Applicative Functors

- **Applicative functors** reuse type identities across multiple applications: applying `F` twice to the same argument yields the same abstract types.  
- **Generative functors** produce fresh types on each application. Model these by stamping new type‐constructor identities during instantiation  ([ML Family Workshop - syslog - University of Cambridge](https://www.syslog.cl.cam.ac.uk/2014/09/05/ml-family-workshop/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
