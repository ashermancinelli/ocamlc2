# Development Cycle

When you make changes, plan out each step and perform small steps each time.

After each change, build and run tests like so

```sh
> ninja -C build p3      
ninja: Entering directory `build'
[1/1] Copying interfaces to distribution directory
.venv
/Users/ashermancinelli/workspace/ocamlc2 [ashermancinelli@Ashers-MacBook-Pro] [17:51]
> lit -svv test   

Testing Time: 1.03s

Total Discovered Tests: 39
  Passed           : 38 (97.44%)
  Expectedly Failed:  1 (2.56%)
```

if you hit a test failure you don't understand, you can try debugging a little bit, but don't be afraid to stop and explain the change you just made and any guesses as to why it caused a failure, and I will step in and look at your changes.
